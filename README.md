## Project Description:
Email spam continues to be a significant issue in the digital world, leading to an influx of unwanted and potentially harmful messages in users' inboxes. To combat this problem, we aim to develop an Email Spam Detection system using the **Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm**. This project will enable the automatic classification of incoming emails as spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content.
##### The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset).
